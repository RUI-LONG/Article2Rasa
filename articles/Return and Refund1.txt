Will I be refunded for items removed from my order?
If any item in your order is out-of-stock, iHerb will remove the item from your order and notify you immediately. 

Rest assured - you won't be charged for any item(s) removed from your order. iHerb processes payments after orders have shipped so you're only charged for the item(s) delivered. 

Any temporary charges will be released according to your bank's policies. Please note, you may not see a refund transaction and your bank may not send you any notification. You should see the new order total charged in your bank statement within 3-5 business days after the order has shipped.

Can Rewards Credit be refunded?
If you paid for your order with Rewards Credit, then you will be refunded back with Rewards Credit. Once your refund is approved, your Rewards Credit will be typically available to use within 24 hours. 

Rewards Credit expires after 90 days of being granted if unused or if no new Rewards Credit is accrued.
